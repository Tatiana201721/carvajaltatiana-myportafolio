	<p>Photography is one of the biggest innovations that exist and it can be a big demonstration of change in history. While we are obsessed with the future and innovation, we still look at the past photos, romanticizing the world that was behind. But what about our present? If we look through the window, we see the world as black and white, but if we take a picture of the same view, we can change and adjust the picture and put filters that make it more colorful. This is a big example that now on social media, there exists a world of fantasy taken by pictures and filters.
In 2026 the influence of tiktok, instagram and other social media are at their peak for the young generation, creating a new virtual life that will be the memories that the younger generation look at, from physical to virtual ones. Even as early in the 1900s you can see the differences in how pictures were used to capture a moment. Before, when it was taken, it was a raw image of the exact moment and the emotions everyone felt at the time. Now when a photo is taken it is likely edited or altered to make the view better or even make themselves look better. Photos are versatile in the way they can be used. Some use it to capture special moments and others want to save a nice view they might have seen. When you think about the word “picture” you most likely think about just images. However, a photographer thinks about the memories behind a picture and the moments behind the photo. In the article by Susan Sontag explains how “Taking photographs fills the same need for the cosmopolitans accumulating photograph‑trophies” this is because they feel the pressure of capturing a moment through a photo.

	<p>Photography can be a good element to build memories to ourselves but if we manipulate and edit the image it is not just affecting your memories, it is affecting more people because when you post the photoshopped picture on your social media it can give an unreal perspective to others. Susan Sontag explains this point by describing a painting or a prose that is similar to what is now called photography, the only difference being that we manipulate and disguise it as the truth. The followers or people that keep scrolling on their phones will believe that they are seeing the real world but it is not. It is just what the user wants to share that makes misinformation, creating false storytypes. 
</p>
	<p>Photography can be a good tool if we use it to make real memories and not just follow the life of others. Instead you should build a life of perfection that keeps you happy in the end. In life there are many cameras but the most important items are instant cameras because they give the raw photo of a crucial moment in our life. The reason being is that those images are more believable than any picture you'll find online or social media.</p>

	<p>AI is changing our perspective of how we perceive the world because in actuality the internet becomes part fundamental in the world. It is incredible how the internet was evolving so much that now applications like sora, banana pro, grok and other intelligence officials are able to make videos that look so real and even allow you to clone yourself, or even worse, allow other people to use your image to create content without your permission. That's why I agree with Nesrine Malik that explains that AI becomes as a psychologically unsafe and untrustworthy which affects not only the new generation but also those of the old generation 
Although the big companies are aware of this unsafe post and the consequences that the use of AI has on people. Fake or misleading information is common with AI but big companies don't say anything and keep influencing this part of the content. Companies that are sources for social media such as, TikTok, Instagram and many more are fine with this happening because it allows more people to create videos and bring engagement to the platform as a whole. AI combined with social media also allows everybody to be informed of events happening around the world or bring attention to unseen problems in languages that can conform to everyone so that no one is left in the dark. We are being bombarded with both true and false information using AI and has manipulated us to the point that we have become blind and more naive, seeking dopamine with every scroll we make on the screen.
When Malik talked about the post that the White House and another agency posted on social media created a point that anything can be posted as a joke that shouldn't be taken seriously. To this day I have come across many posts on social media platforms like X that even the president of the United States uses and posts unseriously and it is alarmingly immature of him regarding the policy he is pursuing. One example of this is when he reposted a video that was made by AI, showing him as a lion king and Obama as a monkey. Demonstrating the lack of importance these videos have and masking some racist and bad thoughts as animated videos using AI to make people see it as entertainment, games or even a simple joke that changes the meaning using an AI generated video. 
However In the article Malik said “ The sense of urgency and action that our crisis-torn world should inspire is instead blunted by how information is presented. Here, there is a new way of sleepwalking into disaster.”  I interpret this as that people know about the problem in society but try to put on a mask or paint the reality of the world. Even though this can be catastrophic because instead of creating a real solution we are evading and changing it only to give a glimmer of hope and because of this, we lose the sense of urgency needed to solve real-world problems. </p>
