	<p>Photography is one of the biggest innovations that exist and it can be a big demonstration of change in history. While we are obsessed with the future and innovation, we still look at the past photos, romanticizing the world that was behind. But what about our present? If we look through the window, we see the world as black and white, but if we take a picture of the same view, we can change and adjust the picture and put filters that make it more colorful. This is a big example that now on social media, there exists a world of fantasy taken by pictures and filters.
In 2026 the influence of tiktok, instagram and other social media are at their peak for the young generation, creating a new virtual life that will be the memories that the younger generation look at, from physical to virtual ones. Even as early in the 1900s you can see the differences in how pictures were used to capture a moment. Before, when it was taken, it was a raw image of the exact moment and the emotions everyone felt at the time. Now when a photo is taken it is likely edited or altered to make the view better or even make themselves look better. Photos are versatile in the way they can be used. Some use it to capture special moments and others want to save a nice view they might have seen. When you think about the word “picture” you most likely think about just images. However, a photographer thinks about the memories behind a picture and the moments behind the photo. In the article by Susan Sontag explains how “Taking photographs fills the same need for the cosmopolitans accumulating photograph‑trophies” this is because they feel the pressure of capturing a moment through a photo.

	<p>Photography can be a good element to build memories to ourselves but if we manipulate and edit the image it is not just affecting your memories, it is affecting more people because when you post the photoshopped picture on your social media it can give an unreal perspective to others. Susan Sontag explains this point by describing a painting or a prose that is similar to what is now called photography, the only difference being that we manipulate and disguise it as the truth. The followers or people that keep scrolling on their phones will believe that they are seeing the real world but it is not. It is just what the user wants to share that makes misinformation, creating false storytypes. 
</p>
	<p>Photography can be a good tool if we use it to make real memories and not just follow the life of others. Instead you should build a life of perfection that keeps you happy in the end. In life there are many cameras but the most important items are instant cameras because they give the raw photo of a crucial moment in our life. The reason being is that those images are more believable than any picture you'll find online or social media.</p>
