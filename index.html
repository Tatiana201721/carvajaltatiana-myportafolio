	<H1>Tatiana Carvajal</h1>
	<p>Hi, I am Tatiana Carvajal, a content creator, photographer, and filmmaker. As someone who studies media, I understand that the best way to bring memories back is through the art of visual expression. Creativity flows in the way that everything can be a story to tell, and each word or phrase can be the next chapter in a life story. I record videos so that people can be inspired by my creativity, which creates a unique theme for the audience that really connects. I want people to see the truth about life, because not everything is aesthetic, and that can be the best part of it. </p>
	<p>I grew up in Ecuador, and I moved to the United States when I was fifteen after a nightmare of an event that changed my life completely. I thought that I had lost all my direction in life until I saw all the memories that I had made on my phone. Short movies that bring the sparkle to my life. It helps me remember who I really am, and that’s what I want people to feel when they watch a short-cut and remind them what the best part about their lives is.</p>
	<p>Being an immigrant can be hard, and even more so if the barrier of language is an obstacle. So I show that communication skills are not just verbal words and language, but can also be understood by images and films. So that way, anyone can have the opportunity to see what’s going on in the world and the feelings of the people without exchanging a word.</p>
